# Image Editor

A simple implementation of an android image editor app.

### Description

I originally built this project to pass off the requirements for a class assignment. It is implented in Java using a supplied Android GUI. It has the functionality of doing a limited amount of image manipulations on .ppm image files.

### Explanatory Note

I created this project before I learned better practices. As such, it's not my best work, but it does help demonstrate the creativity I had even when I was learning.
